# Web-page

I created a web page related to cyber security.
The page contains a range of elements including headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and hyperlinks to relevant websites.  
The contains appropriate and relevant content, and all styling is achieved using an external stylesheet. 
Video content is relevant to the topic and embedded from YouTube (not downloaded)
The page is responsive and utilises CSS media queries to accommodate a range of screen resolution or browser viewport widths.
HTML,Javascript and CSS is included
Th page demonstrates successful understanding of variables, calculations, conditionals, recursion and functions.
 

I also created a multiple choice quiz with 5 questions about my topic, using a HTML form and Javascript.  
A user is  able to select answers using an appropriate form element and press a button to reveal correct answers and user score.
